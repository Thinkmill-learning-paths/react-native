# React Native

## Step 1 - Platform Components

React Native has a different document object model, and so has its own native components. For example, in React Native, there is no such thing as a `<div>` element, instead you would use `<View>`. Similarly, there is no `<a>`, rather we can use `<Button>` or other Touchable components. Similarly, there is no '<p>', rather we can use '<Text>".

Create a blue button with the text "View".

[TODO: insert picture - button]

### Task 2

Create a blue button with the text "View" and add the Right Chevron image alongside the text inside the button.

[TODO: insert picture - button with image]

### Task 3

Create a card component, and add the button created to the footer. The card must have a card body which includes a title and description, and a card footer.

### Task 5

Add a second card, and use [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) to inject data via props.

### Task 6

Tapping the button should navigate to Google.

### Task 7

If the user taps anywhere on the card, navigate the user to Google.
