# Setting up Android

1. Set up your environment for the React Native CLI (not Expo) as described in the [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup).

2. Open `./android folder` in Android Studio

3. Wait for Android Studio to sync, install, update (see progress bar processing at the bottom of the Android Studio window).

   Or, run Gradle Sync, File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files (to rerun)

   > Gradle sync is a gradle task that looks through all of your dependencies listed in your build.gradle files and tries to download the specified version.

4. Build from the Play button inside Android Studio, or from the top bar menu, Run -> Run app

5. Now you can run `yarn run android`
