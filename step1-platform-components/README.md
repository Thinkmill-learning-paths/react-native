### Task 7

> ðŸ“˜ React Native docs - [Debugging](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging)

Add a link to the card footer that says "Quick add". On tap, the link should open an `<Alert />` component with text "Do you want to quick add to cart?" and Alert buttons "Cancel" and "Add".

On tapping "Cancel", dismiss the Alert. On tapping "Add", execute console.log("Added \$PRODUCT_NAME success") and then dismiss the Alert.
