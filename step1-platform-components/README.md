# React Native

## Step 1 - Platform Components

React Native has a different document object model, and so has its own native components. For example, in React Native, there is no such thing as a `<div>` element, instead you would use `<View>`. Similarly, there is no `<a>`, rather we can use `<Button>` or other Touchable components. Similarly, there is no '<p>', rather we can use '<Text>".

Under the hood, React Native's Components internally map to iOS or Android native elements.
