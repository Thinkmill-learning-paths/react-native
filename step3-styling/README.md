## Step 3 - Styling

React Native has a different styling engine to the browser that has a subset of CSS available. Most notably, layout is driven entirely by flexbox as there is no box model.

### Task 1 - Layout

Create a new card component showing an image on the left, and a heading on the right.

Use this image: /assets/40x40.png
Use this heading text: Lorem ipsum

### Task 2

Add a 1px grey border to the card outline. Make the borders rounded by 5px.

### Task 2

Vertically center the heading text to the image.

### Task 3

Add description text below the heading. Add a scroll region to the card body and set the card body height to 40px.

Use this text:
In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is available.

It may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a first-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.

### Task 4

Set a dynamic max-height for the card, which is 300px shorter than screen height in portrait mode or 100px shorter in landscape mode.

### Task 5 - theme

Create a file called "theme" which will contain design tokens. Include tokens for primary colour and a large font size.

Create a view containing a large primary button with text "Buy now".
