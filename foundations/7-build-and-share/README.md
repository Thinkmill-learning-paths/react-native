# React Native

## Foundation 6 - Build and share

Instead of running a connected development instance, you can build a version of the app which will save to your phone and work even when your computer is disengaged.

### Share with a Stakeholder

You can use [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/) to share over cloud with Stakeholders. This requires App Store set up by an App Admin.
