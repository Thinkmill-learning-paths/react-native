## Foundation 8 - Adding plugins

If you are looking for additional functionality, you can install community components or plugins from package managers.

Plugins can be found at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or at React Native's dedicated directory [reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory/).

Many of these modules will require additional installation steps, that are important to follow.
