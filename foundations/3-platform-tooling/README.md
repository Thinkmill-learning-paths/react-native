# React Native

## Foundation 3 - Platform tooling

### IDE's

> React Native docs - [Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

#### iOS

The iOS IDE required is Xcode, which can be installed via the App Store.

#### Android

The Android IDE required is Android Studio.

### JavaScript bundler

React Native uses [Metro Bundler](https://facebook.github.io/metro/), which is the React Native version of Webpack.

You don't need to download this, as it is part of the toolchain which is downloaded when you create app.

### Development environment

#### Simulators

This is the simplest environment to run. You may need to install platform SDK's if you are having trouble getting Simulators to work.

#### Physical device

You are able to run code on your physical device by connecting it over USB.
